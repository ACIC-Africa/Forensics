## Disk Analysis
### Types of Disks
- [Magnetic Storage Drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_storage) - Use Magnets to read and write (Example: Magnet Tapes)
- [Optical Storage Drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_storage) - Use laser beams to read binary data (Example: CD, DVD)
- [Flash Memory Devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory) - Non-volatile memory that can retain data in memory. (SSD Drives, BIOS Chip, Memory Cards)
- [Hard Disk Drive (HDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive) - Non-volatile memory that stores data magnetically.
- [Solid State Drive (SSD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive) - Non-volatile memory that implements Solid state technology to store dat like a hard disk drive. Uses NAND Based SSD to store data even after power failure and Volatile RAM-based SSD for fast data access.
### Logical System Structure
This is dependent on the file system used and the operating system used to read data.
- [FAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table) - Originally designed for floppy disks and used on DOS and Windows 9x systems.
- [FAT32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table#FAT32)
- [NTFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS) - Supported on Windows, Linux, BSD and read-only support on macOS
- [EXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_system) - UNIX
- [EXT 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext2) - exist in GNU Hurd, MINIX 3, some BSD kernels, in MiNT, and as third-party Microsoft Windows and macOS drivers.
- [EXT 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext3)
- [EXT 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4)
- [EFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extent_File_System)
### Hard Disk Interfaces
- [Serial ATA (SATA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA)
- [Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI)
- [Serial Attached SCSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Attached_SCSI)
- [ATA/PATA (IDE/EIDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ATA)
