## Disk Analysis
### Types of Disks
- [Magnetic Storage Drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_storage) - Use Magnets to read and write (Example: Magnet Tapes)
- [Optical Storage Drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_storage) - Use laser beams to read binary data (Example: CD, DVD)
- [Flash Memory Devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory) - Non-volatile memory that can retain data in memory. (SSD Drives, BIOS Chip, Memory Cards)
- [Hard Disk Drive (HDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive) - Non-volatile memory that stores data magnetically.
- [Solid State Drive (SSD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive) - Non-volatile memory that implements Solid state technology to store dat like a hard disk drive. Uses NAND Based SSD to store data even after power failure and Volatile RAM-based SSD for fast data access.
